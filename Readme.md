# __Git and GitHub__
## What is a Git ?
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) commonly used in software development to track changes in source code during the development process. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, initially to manage the development of the Linux kernel.

## Here's how it works:
> ### __1. Repository:__  _Git operates on the concept of a repository, which is a collection of files and folders along with the history of changes made to those files. Each project typically has its own repository._
> ### __2. Commits:__  _A commit is a snapshot of changes made to the files in the repository at a particular point in time. Developers make changes to files, then "commit" those changes to the repository along with a message describing the changes._
> ### __3. Branches:__ _Git allows for the creation of branches, which are essentially divergent paths of development. They allow developers to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Branches can be merged back into the main codebase when the changes are ready._
> ### __4. Merging:__ _Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. This is typically done to incorporate the changes made in feature branches back into the main development branch._
> ### __5. Remote Repositories:__ _Git also supports working with remote repositories, which are copies of the repository stored on a server. Developers can push their changes to a remote repository to share their work with others, and pull changes from the remote repository to incorporate changes made by others._

Overall, Git provides a powerful and flexible way for developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and manage different versions of their code.
